// Server-authoritative pricing. Mirrors the hard-won lesson from
// nodedr-pos (see its project memory): the price entered against a menu
// item is TAX-INCLUSIVE, not tax-exclusive — GST/VAT must be backed OUT of
// it, never added on top. A flat/percent discount is computed against the
// tax-inclusive subtotal directly (the rupee amount a cashier actually
// types), not against an already-backed-out exclusive base — computing it
// the other way under-discounts the customer, a distinct trap from the
// inclusive/exclusive bug itself.
//
// Never re-derive this from scratch on future pricing changes — round with
// round2, verify numerically (a clean MRP like 118 at 18% backs out to
// exactly 100), and confirm totalAmount never exceeds the sum of entered
// prices before any discount.
//
// Multi-region tax (2026-09-27): a branch's taxMode decides how a raw menu
// item price is turned into the tax-inclusive unit price this file works
// off of. INCLUSIVE (India GST / EU VAT / Spain IVA — tax-inclusive menu
// prices are the norm/regulation in all three) passes the entered price
// through unchanged, exactly as before. EXCLUSIVE (US sales tax — prices
// are conventionally shown pre-tax, tax added at checkout) grosses it up
// by the tax rate first. toEffectiveInclusiveUnitPrice is the ONLY place
// that conversion happens; priceLine/computeOrderTotals below are
// unchanged and still always operate on an inclusive amount, so every
// downstream consumer (OrderItem.lineTotal, receipts, refunds, KOTs) keeps
// working exactly as it did before this file existed.
