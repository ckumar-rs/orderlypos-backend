// Bill and settlement arithmetic, kept free of I/O so the exact figures a
// cashier sees, the printed bill and the checkout charge all come from one
// place and can be unit-tested. Prices here are tax-INCLUSIVE (see pricing.ts).
//
// Discount and tax: a discount is given on the tax-inclusive price, so it
// reduces the taxable value too. The tax breakup shown on the bill is scaled
// by (subtotal - discount) / subtotal, i.e. the discount is spread pro-rata
// over the lines. Loyalty points are a form of tender, not a price reduction,
// so redeeming them does not change the tax. Tips and delivery fees are
// outside the taxable subtotal. A service charge is part of the taxable
// value (India CGST s.15): GST is added on it at the same rate already
// on the food, taken from this bill — not a hardcoded restaurant rate.
